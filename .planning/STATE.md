# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** Proactively alert when Zigbee devices are offline or low on battery so they can be fixed before the user notices missing functionality around the house.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Alert Delivery -- complete. Ready for Phase 4: Web UI

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 5 (Alert Delivery) -- Complete
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-16 -- Completed 03-03 (Dispatcher and watchdog integration)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 03]: Bridge monitor treats missing/malformed payloads as offline (safe default)
- [Phase 03]: First run defaults wasOnline=true so initial offline is detected as transition
- [Phase 03]: HTML email uses inline styles (email clients strip external CSS)
- [Phase 03]: Strict shell sanitization: replace quotes, strip backticks/dollar/backslash for Loxberry notify
- [Phase 03]: 10s Nodemailer timeouts (connection/greeting/socket) to stay within 30s hard timeout
- [Phase 02]: 5% battery hysteresis band; alert at <=25%, recover only above 30%
- [Phase 02]: Strict greater-than for offline threshold boundary (exactly 24h = not offline)
- [Phase 02]: normalizeAlerts handles legacy Phase 1 state missing recovered_at fields
- [Phase 02]: formatSummary is private helper in watchdog.js; console format locked as "N alerts (X offline, Y battery), N recovery, N excluded"
- [Phase 01]: Used ini@5.x over v6 for stability
- [Phase 01]: collectMessages accepts drain_seconds directly; caller merges CRON config
- [Phase 01]: client.end(true) on error for forced disconnect vs end(false) for clean drain
- [Phase 01]: Stale lock timeout 60s for pidfile locking; readState returns copy of empty state to prevent mutation
- [Phase 01]: Exported main() for testability; mergeDeviceState preserves devices not in current registry
- [Phase 03]: Bridge offline skips device evaluation entirely to avoid false positives from stale data
- [Phase 03]: State written twice per run: once after evaluation, once after notification delivery to clear pending

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1, 3, 4 require live Loxberry host verification before implementation (plugin directory layout, notification API, PHP version).
